lNTRODUCTlON. XLV

true,· true, because it is an existing thing. When we inquire if it has
any truth beyond this, we are forced to reply in the negative. A pro·
position reflected, so to speak, back upon itself, can mean nothing but
itself; and in so far as it seems to mean something else, it is false. 'l'hus
every such proposition is both true and false, though in different ways
(p. 205, l. 35, 36). ln the case of the tyrant and his bridge‚ Wyclif
cuts the Gordian knot by shortly stating that such a case would never
happen; and that if it did, the man should he made to pass over (no
doubt because in either case the attendants would fail to do their duty,
and it mattered not what they did). As for the two slaves, mentioned
above, it is doubtful whether they have not fulfrlled the conditione of
freedom imposed by their master; and as the law is in favour of liberty
(eo quod jura faveant libertati) they ought both to be set free (p. 208,
1. 8 to p. 209, 1. 24).

Α little further, Wyclif explains his theory more clearly still. Let
C stand for the proposition: The irreoning os C is lrue. This is true in
the sense that C exists. True als0, in that it means something, viz„ ilsels.
But false, if it be taken to mean anything further (p. 216, l. 14 to p. 219,
1. 5). Ηο10 11 13 clear that Wyclif, saying that such a proposition is
unmeaning in the third sense, says what amounts to affirming that itis no
proposition at all, as we understand the word nowadays. For him, the word
has a far wider extension. Every thing is a proposition (Log. vol. Ι. p.
15, 1. 12-22), because it signifies itself, and makes itself known; he
cannot therefore refuse to call an ‘insoluhle’ by that name. But what le
says, stripped of the numerous intricacies and subtleties which render
this part 01 his work very difficult to understand, comes, l think, to
the same.

One word more before we conclude. lt is easy to be seen, from

many different answers given to this question, that at Wyclif' s time it was

considered to be a very important and difficolt problem; and also that
Wyclif, having laboured hard, and in the main successfully, to solve it,
is entitled to the just praise which he felt that he deserved. His closing
words, both modest and dignifred, may be quoted here.

“This matter has given me more trouble and occupied me fora
longer space of time than any other part 01 Logic. Nor do l doubt that
every one of the authors of thesis above-mentioned tlreories has also
bestowed much care on the 11111113 which they have discovered relative

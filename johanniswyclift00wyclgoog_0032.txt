because of clouds that arise from the earth itsell. ln like manner, God's
not willing me to do good (is He willed it, l should do good without =
lail) would proceed from an obstacle 011 my part- my non-reception of
llis grace; just as in tbe case ol the sun's rays, What is not received
cannot possibly be given. But l an responsible lor not receiving it
through my lault (p. 107, l. 8 to p. 108, l. 20).

So far, sin and its possibility and origin is explained in the ortho-
dox way, and reconciled with God’s First and absolute Causality. But
Wyclif closes the chapter with one or two sentences which, even il
delensible, have a somewhat strange sound. God cannot ⁴but be the
First Cause ol all; and therefore, though indirectly, ol every act, in·
cluding sin: ol the eternal truth that whatever is able to sin may sin at
some time or other; ol the creation ol such peccable beings; and also
ol the very happening (contingentiae, p. 108, l. 33) ol the act, which is
thus radically dependent upon God. We must, however, remark that there
is no attempt to lix the sinlulness ol any act upon God. On the con-
trary, says Wyclil, in so far as God is the author os sin, sin is good.
Whatever is true is good; and the possibility ol every sin depends
upon the everlasting truth already laid down. 'l‘hus we have a logica
deductiori as lollows:

A, B, C . . . .. Z are severally able to sin.
We suppose the creationi os Α, B, C Z.

Also that, in Wyclil’s system, ruha! is able to sin means tvhal (at
one time or other, or [in one subject or other) will aclrtally comittit
sim lor able to does not signily mere abstract possibility, but the ne·
cessity ol a future happeuing.

Theu we necessarily-'have that either A, or B, or C ..... or Z

will at some instant or otherus all time (either the instant a, or b, or
c .... or z) actually commit sin.

Here we see, not only that there is no necessity lor any ol the
given singulars taken in particular A, B, C, dre. to sin at all, but also
that it is not necessary that the sin should take place at a given instant
ol time. And as contingency is the opposite ol necessity, we now see
what Wyclis means when he says that sin is ol the extremest contingcncy
(summa contingentia); lor the truth would be verihed il only one ol the
multitude A, B, C, &c sinned but once.

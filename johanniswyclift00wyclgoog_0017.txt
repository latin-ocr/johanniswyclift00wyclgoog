lt would hc a false argument to say: “hlanhood is a thing identical with
Socrates and with Plato: therefore, Socrates is Plat0.” ln like manner,
to say: “Being is God and is Not-God; therefore God is Not-God” —
is false too (p. 38, l. 10-34). We may say: “Thai which (meaning, or
as Wyclif sayS, pointing to, dentonslraos Transcendental Being) is Not·
God is God:’' but we cannot infer thence that the creature is God
(pp. 38, 39). But to admit even the former proposition seems perilously
near Pantheism: so we must not be surprised if Wyclif reverts to this
point and supporta his distinction with analogies drawn from the pro·
foundest mysteries of the Christian religion.

Third. 'l‘o grant that the Universal Man is identical with each of
its singulars seems to imply its doing and being all that every individual
does and is. lt is thus at the same time awake and asleep, white and
black, lte, together with countless other contradictory attributes (p. 39,
1.38 to end; p. 40, l. 1—14). This objection may be solved either nega·
tively or in the affirmative. Man is that which is white and that which
is black3 but Man is not white and black. For, as a universal, this term
can receive no predicates but such as are essential to human nature:
and it is evident that neither whiteness nor blackness are thus essential
(p. 4ο, l. 15 to p. 42, l. ὁ). But again, taking ideal humanity as the
exemplar and prototype of each man, and consequently as the cause of
each, we may grant that it does every one of the actions of each. So
universals do receive accidents: not indeed in themselves, but in their
singulars, with which they are identical: and the countless different attri-
butes, which are 0r may be contradictory in their singulars, are not so
in thern (p. 42, l. 5-25). This explanation is similar to that of theolo-
gianS, who deny that the Godhead suffered, although it was thot rvhiclr

suffered, i. e. the person of Christ (p. 42, l. 28 to p. 44, l. 25). Several

other objections are propounded and solved in the same way, by pointing
either to the mystery of the lncarnation or to that of the 'l¹rinity; in the
latter, the essence of the Deity is substantially the same in each of the
three persons; yet the Three are really distinct. The Father is not the Son,
although that which is the Father is that adrieli is the Son. “To every
sophism against Real Universals you can lind a parallel one against the
Holy Trinity,’' says Wyclif (p. 46, l. 18-22). Very true; and it there·
fore follows that, sor a Christian, the distinction is not meaningless,
meaningless as it may seem. But the following would seem an obvious

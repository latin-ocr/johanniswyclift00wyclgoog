observations concerning the nature ol promises and obligations (pp. 60,
61) with which he deals at some length. He then takes up a series os
objections, in which absurdities, very similar to those os which he accuses
his adversaries, are laid to his charge.

1. We are never obliged to give anything but what we have pro·
mised. li then the promise concertis only a universal penny, nothing

obliges us to give a singular one! Besides, as we may suppose that the

other party has a (universal) penny already, how can we give aman
what he possesses? So the Realist, not the Nominalist, standpoint is the
ruin ol promises obligations, and in short ol all human intercourse
whatsoever (p. 61, l. 26—37).

The answer is that we are indeed not obliged to give anything
buta universal penny, since no other is promised. But thal we are
obliged to give; and since it cannot be given without the singular which
contains it, any one os its singulars must be handed over. As to the
man's already possessing a universal penny, that has nothing to do with
the matter: he must possess it in reason of the promise made, even though
he had it already, and independently thereos. He then will have it in one
more oi its singulars, i. e. more plentisully (abundantius). Wyclif adds, with
atouch ol dry and possibly unconscious humour, that the multiplied pos·
session ol a universal penny in its singulars is highly advantageous
(multum confert). Thus, il a promise concerns the Universal, its execu-
tion regards its singulars (p. 62, l. 16 to p. 63, 1. 5). That the common
people know nothing of universals is quite false; they have a sort ol
confused knowledge of them. Even those who deny their existence cannot
help contradicting themselves and agreeing with us in practice (p. 63, l.15
to p. 64, l. 7).

2. “Bon’' the adversary urges, “1 for one deny the existence, even
the possibility of a real universal penny. So, at least when I promise

⁴ one, the promise must be that os asingular: lreally mean to give, and
lcannot mean what is in my opinion impossible. Thus universality is
not necessarily implied by the words of the promise in my case; and il
not in my case, in none” (p. 61, l. 37 to p. 62, l. 5). “Quite the con-
trary,²’ replies Wyclit. εὟου may intend promising one particular penny
-the one, lor instance, that you will happen to give - but you
cannot help implicitly meaning the Universal which it contains. No doubt
it is promised vnguely in this case; still it is promised. That you have

anybody else. A, meeting B who is a slave, is free that very instant3

therefore B is also free, meeting a free man; therefore A is also a slave.

And so on.
Debates on such questions bave practically been dead for many

centuries; they are considered as mere useless subtleties. And to speak
quite frankly on this matter, they really seem ridiculous enough, even to
a man pretty well versed in scholastic lore. But the greater the tempt-
ation for men of culture to endorse the sweeping judgments of that
proverbially narrow-minded individual - the man in the street - the
more they ought to strive against it. They well know that most of the
present philosophical debates, though not apparently now so ridiculouS,
because fashionable, will appear so in th'e course of a few hundred
years. All that we can say of them with certitude is that they serve to
sharpen the wits by going as deep down into tbe principles of things
and the lawe of thought as it is possible to go. If these old world dis·
cussiohs then served the same purpose, they are worth studying at least
from a historica! point of view. And at any rate, the reader will per·
baps feel some interest in tbe solution to these puzzleS, given from what
Isbould conceive to be the modern standpoint. Isay, I should conceive,·
for 1 have been able to find nothing directly referring to them in any
modern work of Logic, not even in the Neo-Scholastic text books of
Liberatore and 'l‘ongiorgh nor in that of the Thomist Goudin who, in
the 17⁰¹ century, argued with overwhelming violence to prove the im·
mobility of the earth.

We should, lfancy, make but short work of all such propositions,
The main point of the difficulty is that every proposition must be either
true or false; the subject afhrming of the predicate either the thing that
is or the thing that is not. Now, taking any one of these propositions,
we are compelled by overpowering evidence to admit that it is impos-
sible to call them either true or false. Well then, what follows? Why,
that they are nol propositions!¹ 'l'hey are mere strings of unmeaning

¹ AScholnstic friend to whom l showed this said to me: “What would you
answer to What is written here is a proposition? lt could be admitted without
danger; and if you say that it is not, then by affirming its contrary, you admit that
it has meaning.’' This was subtle. lanswered that it could bo admitted without
danger, but that, belonging to tho same class of sentences, it had logically to he
not denied, but set aside. lt chauces that by thus ignoring. l apparently denicd it;

lNTRODUCTlON. XXXIII

merely disadvantageous, or physically or morally bad. God is in no wise
evil; He is ol use to all; even his punishments are not injurious. Nor
can be commit moral evil, Wyclil here (p. 124, l. 34 to p. 125, l. 15)
correcta or qualifies what he said at the close ol the loregoingchapter,
God cannot make a man to sin ; but when He permits evil, lle gives it
an element ol goodness by the very fact. A man sins, therefore it is
true (and consequently good) that he sins: God makes the inserence,
but does not posit the premiss. Good to all (p. 125, l. 15-35), lle is
inlinitely good in Himsell, and sinitely so to His creatores. Many things
that we call evil are in reality good; as, lor instance, punishments and
missortunes (p. 126, l. 15-20); and in many cases we mistake the value
ol things, which varies according to supply and demand (l. 22*25).
These never can be exactly regulated. Even should the variation in
price not spring lrom the wickedness ol men, it is impossible to six ’
prices exactly. We must leave that to nature; the real worth ol any·
thing is its utility in the universe. - This is a clear and lar-seeing con·
demnation ol the many attempta to six or keep up prices which
were so common durIng the Middle Ages, and are sar from abandoned
even at the present day. ln these lew sentences we find Free 'l‘rade in
its germ.

‘Hindrance’ and ‘obstacle’ generally mean the reverse ol utility;
but in a certain sense they may not be evils. ll, lor instance, God is
said to hinder any one from attaining eternal bliss, it is in order to
work out His plan of the world, in which predestination plays a prin·
cipal part. The natural tendency uf all things is to sink to the centre.;
but some must be impeded in their descent, or the order of the uni·
verse would perish.Wyclil, however, speaks very guardedly here (sorte . . .
difficultates plurimae, p. 128, l. 34-36) and brings the chapter to a
close without going into any details on this subject.

Chapter VII. llere our author, availing himself of comparative
propositions, his nominal subject-matter, deals ex professo with the ques·
tion whether there is lor every laculty, or active power, amaximum aud
aminimum ol intensity beyond which it cannot gu either way. Of course

he asserts that there is, and in his answer to the objections, he dis·

cusses various and very diverse questions, including God's omnipotence,
the limits to human strength, size, and knowledge, the beatisrc vision,

and our natural faculty os¹ sight.

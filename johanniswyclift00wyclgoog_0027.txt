Wyclil speaks ol necessity, he may mean that, given the fact ol sree·
will and the actions resulting therelrom, things cannot be otherwise than
they are; this, however, is osten set forth in language which must have
astonished the ordinary Catholic. ln Buddensieg’s edition of Wyclif's
Polemical Works there is a tract entitled De Persectione Statuam, in
which (rol. ll, p. 450, l. 5-18) a passage occurs that evidently sup·
poses free-will. Now this tract, according to Buddensieg, dates [rom 1383,
quite at the close ol our author's lile. But, on the other hand, this, as
directed against the Friars, may be explained away as an argument ‘ad
hominem’. And in the Dialogus, when accused ol satalism‚ he might
easily have destroyed the charge by the well-known distinction between
absolute and hypothetical necessity. l'et he gives none, and simply ad·
mits the necessity ol all things that happen (Dial. pp. 45, 46). That
some change or other took place in Wyclif's doctrine is evident from
the following passage in Dc Ecclesia (p. 107, l. 12 and seq.), in which
he explicitly admits the lact: “Omnia fictura cle necessitate eveniunt . . ..
Quando autem variavi ab ista sententia, non cognovi, ut modo, quomodo
res habet multiplex esse, sed omne esse posui existentiam individuam rei
in suo genere.’' How he reconciles this doctrine with free-will is not
quite clear to me, as Ι have not been able to find a passage dealing
with [ree-will at any length, except a very orthodox one in De Ente
Praedicamenlali (p. 247); hut this treatise‚ according to Dr. Beer, could
not hare been posterior to Logica by more than a lew years. But we
must not rashly assume that he did not reconcile them. The Dominicans‚
in their great controversy with the Jesuits, alhrmed that God predeter-
mined all human acts, making all things act according to their nature;
so that, as the nature ol will is to act freely, human acts were at once
predetermined and free! And this theory was not condemned by the

Church! — Hating thrown out these lew hints which may possibly be

ol use, I return to the summary ol Wyclil’s arguments

'l'he distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic possibility has no
real foundation. A seemingly possible soul is in reality impossible, if
God has chosen never to create it. 'l'he number therefore os souls
extrinsically possible is that ol all those which at any time will exist in
reality; it is consequently sinite, though the abstract idea, ‘Soul' contains
an infinite multitude ol singulam, lor all those singulars to which their
cause (i. e. God's will) is wanting, imply seli-contradiction. Wyclil con·

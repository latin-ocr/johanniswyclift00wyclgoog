he defeated by any greater force. This is the difference between active
and passive power. Now, in the sense pointed out, either 01 these
powers is without limit. - Wyclif replies that, in the sense given,
passive power is amere imperfection. lf understood to mean receptivity
of forms (03 111 the case of matter, primordial or other) without doubt
there is a limit to that receptivity. Seuse=impressions have likewisc their
limits, and produce 0 wrong jurlgment when the senses are too strongly
stimulated in one particular vvay. Thence it is clear that our intellect‚
which perceives all things, cannot perceive them by means 01 any bodily
organ; and also that there is a maximum of receptivity 101 00011 01 1101
300303. Thus, whether active 01 passive, the power at work is in every
case a form; and this form cannot be indefinitely perfect (p. 138, l. 2 3- 3o;
p. 140, l. 23 to p. 142, l. 35).

2. God's power would be restricted by this theory; for then,
even by a miracle‚ He could not make any creature go beyond the
maximum of its power (p. 138, l. 30-38). - Answer. lt is one
thing to know that there are limits even to miraculous assistance, 01111
another to know what those limits are. God certainly could not, even
by a misaele, make a stone think. His assistance is necessary in every
act, and miraculous assistance only displaces the limit, but does not
destroy it (p. 142, l. 36 to p. 143, l. 32). is there such a thing
as the most rapid movement possible? Wyclif asserts that there 13.
As time is made up 01 indivisible instants, so movement also consists
01 indivisible degrees 01 velocity‚ and the most rapid movement
possible is that which 1110100303 01 every instant by one such indivisible
degree. This is however, even from Wyclif’s point 01 view, not
the most rapid, but the most rapidly increasing motion possible;
and surely we may suppose that at every instant the movement might
increase by· troo degrees of velocity. That would certainly give us a
more rapid motion: but the passage is 1101 very clear, and l am not
quite sure l have understood it rightly. - As 101 infinitely rapid
movement, Wyclif at once sets it down either as impossible (as in the
hypothetical 0030 given by Aristode, 01 movement in tracum· for 0
vacuum is an absurdity) 01 else as 001 being properly a quantity. Here
our author probably allodes to the instantaneous nature 01 1110 movement
01 light, a doctrine universally believed before the discovery of the telescope

had rendered possible the celebrated observations on the eclipses of Jupiter’s

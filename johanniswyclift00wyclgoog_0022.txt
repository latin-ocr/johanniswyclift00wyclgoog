it not in your mind, nay, thatyou positively exclude it from your mind,
is an altogether irrelevant fact (p. 64).'' Ill may be allowed to clear up
the meaning ο1 this by an example, we may suppose that one man pro·
mises to give another a piece ol land in which he is convinced that
there are no mineral richcs whatever. Now it so happens that he is
mistaken: does the lact of his belief render it untrue that, in promising
the land, he has promised all its mineral riches? When you say: lpro·
mise a penny — asingular one - you surely promise all that is con-
tained in that penny: now we say that a Universal is contained therein,
and that, willing or unwilling, you promise it. - Here Wyclif, in con-
nection with the indefinite universal term, a penny, makes some remarks
by the way about terms ol the srrst and second intention and imposition
respectively. Ι1 3 singular penny is spoken of, the sense, primarily uni·
-versal, is contracted by the term singular. The promising verb indicates
universality, and that is promised in any case. For instance, 1 have two
pennies, and promise you one ol the two. That means neither in parti-
cular: and it follows that the object ο1 any promise must be universal
(11· ⁶4, ⁶7)-

3. A third difficulty, made up 31 several put together, runs thus:
Transcendental Being is identical with everything‚ and at the same time
with anything in the world: 11 Ι promise something, it follows that every·
thing has been promised! And yet such a promise comes to nothing in
reality. lbuy a manJ 11 the meaning ο1 this be ‘Universal Man', thenit
includes mysell; yet l surely cannot buy my own person. And it might
bejsproved 13 the same way that what is promised is not promised
(v- ⁶², ¹· 5-1sl·

All this is mere sophistry. The promise ol Something is valid; hut
the very smallest thing given lulsrls it, and so it happens to be an idle
one, legally speaking3 but that is not because its object is universal.
There are many such cases which judges would put out 31 court as sri-

volousfuNoticc, however, that when the singulars ol any universal are ol

equal value, any one ol them will d0; when their ralues differ, we may
not choose at will any one ο1 the worst, but may bc compelled by law
to give une 31 average worth. (1 suspect that Wyclil’s opponents might
havelfound means to cavil here. You promise. a horse3 you give a hack
only srt to bc slaughtered; but you hare given the ‘Universal horse’ with

these details rapidly, only noting the conclusion: that the material 3111313

final cause. The ultimate End of all beings is that toward which all
beings tend, and for which they all exist, 'whilst it exists for 113311 31333.
Thus it can have no parts, but must be absolutely simple in its essence;
for if it had parts, every one would be caused, and would exist only
for the whole. Two beings may cause oue another in different lines of
causation, but notin the same (pp. 92-96).

Every causal proposition is reduplicative. For instance: You move,
since you walk, means Inasmuclr as you walle, you moue. Therefore,
though other propositions are also reduplicative (as: The more alike
two things are, the less they differ), Wyclif takes the present occasion
to investigate the nature of reduplicatives, and continues his investigation
in the following chapter. thnever such a proposition is reducible to a
causal one, the predicate must be universal. 11, 131 instance, Every man.

qua man, is rational, then it also follows that Every rational being is a

man. This is not always the ease when the proposition cannot thus be
reduced (pp. 96-98 to l. ὁ).

11313 comes a difficulty. Suppose we say: A ntan, in so sar as he
is white, does not build: is this true, and may we consider that ‘white-
ness’ is not a cause of his building? Some assert that we may n0t; for
the whole man builds, and whiteness is an attribute of the whole man.
Wyclif, on the contrary, thinks that the proposition is true. The con-
nection between this apparently useless and meaningless subtlety and the
profound mysterics of the Scholastic doctrine concerning the hypostasis,
or essence of individuality, becomes clearer, when we ask, Did Christ,
qua God, suffer and dic? Did Hc, quo man, create the world? T he
answer given is in strict accordance with orthodoxy (p. 98, 1. 6 to

This leads us to examine what such modes of being as white-
ness, &c., added to the substance, are in themselves. Rea} they are no
doubt, according to the general drift of Wyclif's opinions; but are they
realities distinct from the substance to which they belong and which
they modify? 11 33, every substance would, in each of its modifications,
differ from itself. But the difference is merely mudal, not substantial;
only the modes differ: to be thus or otherwise, and to be existiug, are

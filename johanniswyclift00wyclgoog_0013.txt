lNTRODUCTlON.

To put their attack into somewhat more modern language than
the crabbed form os the text: Is you say. “Socrates is an animal and
rt is an ass?³ you mean that the universal “AnimaP' is replaced by it.
But suppose you substitute rontano lor animal; the sense os i! is at
once altered. Substitute mamam& the sense varies again. Thus we have
an endless series ol different significations given to ir, each os them more
concrete, yet none ever reaching the ultimate limit ol individuality. This
would be the ruin os all science; lor we could never draw any inference
from the universal to its singulars3 and between each ol these il's there
could be found or imagined room lor an infinite multitude of others. These
constantly changing significations would destroy the possibility of deduction.
”A is an animal; it (not A, but the animal) is a vertebrate3 it (the vertebrate)
is a mammal³³ — and so on. We can never conclude that Α is this singular
individual man (p. 27, l. 20—37). Wyclil answers (pp. 28-30) that,
though less universal as a predicate than its antecedent, it has as a
subject the power ol standing sor the same, and consequently lor all the
singulars which that antecedent represents There is indeed an endless
desecat, because there is an infinite distance between any universal and
its singulars. But, when we get to the lowest species os all, we have
only accidents, that is, non-essential differences, by which the singulars
are distinguished; so that makes no difficulty. Il we say that one uni·
versal is infinitely beyond another, because it extends to more singulars,
this does not mean that it is infinite, any more than a sorsace, infinitely
greater than. a line, would be infinite.

Beaten off on one side (as we may perhaps be allowed to suppose)
the Nominalists return to the charge on another. “You say that he does
not stand for an individual. Let us then suppose that two men, Socrates
and Plato, are running.” The proposition, “Somebody run3,'' will be
true; but at the same time it will be true to add: “Socrates is not Ire,
and Plato is not Ιιι’.” Now, what is no one else in the world is running
at the time? (p. 27, l. 37 to end3 p. 28, l. 1-12). This however is met
(p. 30, 31) by denying that ‘lte' has here the meaning of a universal
man. lt is clearly a singular, meaning tlte somebody who runs in both
cases, and in one os the two it could not but be salse.

T hc third argument is aimed more directly against universals. Eaclr
os them stands for· all its singulars. But lte, according to the supposition,
is a unirersal. We may say ol'sl, lle is a king; and os lt, He is a thiel.

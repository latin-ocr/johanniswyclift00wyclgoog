concrete? Such cantion Wyclil thought excessirc; it now remaius lor us
to see how bc fought — most courageously and skihnlly, it must bc
aclcnowledged — against this objection in its various forms.

ι Faithsul to his accustomed method ol showing a bold front to disli-
culties‚ and never shirking them, however weighty they may be, be at
once proceeds to enquire, 1⁵¹ How we can distinguisb Universals from
their singulam, aud lrom each otber3 2¹¹d How the transcendent entity,
Being, is common both to God and to His creatures; 3³¹ Whether alini·
versal can receive accidental attributes, and 4¹¹¹ Whetber a Universal,
taken together with its singulars, makes up a number.

Ftrst. Every Universal is all its singulars, and each os them. lt
would seem that is s0, it cannot be distinguished from them, nor from
any other Universal that might bappen to be those singulars too (p. 34,
end). We are lree to deny that the Unit'ersal is its singulars; it is in
them, but is not they, having· no personal supposition, as they hare. Rut
it is preferable to admit that it is its singulars, and, thus considered,
receives a different persona] suppositiou in each. 'this supposition, which
it has in its singulars and not by itself, is amply sullicieut to differentiatc
it from them (p. 35). In some cases this difference may be merely logical
or notional, but still it sullices lor a distinctiun; as that between the one
universal Phieuix and the one phunix existing in the physical world.
Eacb is identical with'tbe other in all but the lact that the universal

Phoenix is (at least successively) communicable to many, whilst the cor-

poreal phoenix is not. Thus, as we see, eren in this test ease, there
always remains, between the Universal and its singular, one differtum,
- communicability (p. 37).

Second. If God is Being, and the creature is a being, and Being
is a universal reality, the same in both: then we come to the Pantheistic
conclusion that there is something common to God and His creatureS,
and really identical in both (pp. 37, 38). And in lact, as the Nomina-
listic position logically ends in Materialism‚ so Realism — unless it
carelully steers the middle course which has been mentioned ·- neces·
sarily teuds towards (though not necessarily goes lo) the extremes ol
Pantheism. To answer the objectiou, we must note that transcendent
being is not in God and in the creature as a difference; - lor instance,
’ in the way that rationality exists in all men — but as a mode. This mode
is one in itself; but it exists in God otherwise than in the creature.

XLIV lN'l'RODUCTlON.

words having the looks os propositions, but not their nature. They are
not absurd merely; an absurdity is not quite unmeaning; This square
is round, clearly means an impossibility, and its denial is evidently true.
Not incoherent: The number three is fragrant, does not even seem to
mean anything but the raving os a lunatic‚ which no one cares to deny. Not
mere gibberish: Blitri is Blalhro may be equally well denied or assir·
med, nobody knowing what they are. The so-called propositions in
question are in reality a peculiar class os pseudo-propositions: words
which appear to have a meaning, but which salsisy both themselves and
their contradictories. And this, I think, would be quite enough 1ο satissy
modern students os logie.

The idea os so simple and easy a solution did not, it would seem,
strike any os Wyclis’s contemporaries3 and he himself, though coming
nearest to it in my opinion, does not quite hit the mark. Some ol them
assumed that such propositions were neither salse nor true (p. 194.
l. 24-37). Some, that they were both true and salse (p. 194, l. 38 10
p. 195, l. 14). Others, that they were in reality exceptive propositione
as no proposition can include itsels in its own meaning (p. 195, l. 14 to
p. 191), l. 20). Some said that the words implied contradiction is under-
stood as they were, but they did not explain how they were 1ο be un·
derstood otherwise (p. 196, l. 20 to p. 197, l. 20). And others again
denied that such words as proposition, true, salse, &c., could receive
universal extension (p. 197, l. 20 10 p. 199, l. 9). Several other opinions
are enumerated besides (pp. 199—203). Wyclis taking the material or
grammatica! side os the definition 01 a proposition, saw that both subject
and predicate had meaning apart, and that they were joined by a copula;
he naturally could not see his way to denying thatin such cases there
was no proposition. But then, how could it be one, is it had no meaning,
is it neither assumed nor denied anything? Wyclis's answer (p. 203 10
end os work), comes 10 pretty nearly the same as the one l have given
above. Itis nos a proposition in the ordinary sense 01 the word, sor, in
this ordinary sense, it has absolutely no meaning, But it exists. Whatever

exists‚ means its own existence. ln that sense, every such proposition is

but l do not really. “What is written here is not 1 proposiri0n” in my mouth does
not contradict “What is written here is 1 proposition'' on the paper, any more
than Iam a man spoken by one person is contradicted by I am nol a 1111111, spoken
by another, (See Wyclis s acute remarks on this subject, pp. 240 and 24¹ to l. 11.)

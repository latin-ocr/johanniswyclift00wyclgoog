Is there any midcourse between this doctrine and that 01 such Realists
as affirm that there is in man a humanity corresponding to our idea,
and 110111 1111011001 111 all 113 singulars? There ist it is the theory of
Moderate Realists. To ascribe the universality 01 our ideas to a mere
groundless 1101100 01 the mind would destroy the objective valne of all
reasuning. To suppose ,that there exists a mysterious something, substan·
tially identical in each and all of the singular objects that come under a
general name, would land us in endless difficulties, with which we shall
soon see Wyclif attempting to grapple. They therefore draw a sharp
distinction between the Universal, as not seen by the mind, and as seen.
The Universal‚ as formally existing in many singulars, is nowhere but in
the mind. Everything that exists in nature is formally concrete, and 310-
gular 10 113 essence. Thus the Universal, as lenonia, is nothing bnt a
10010 abstraction. But, as 0111010 beluosus, itis otherwise; itis real;
in each singular it exists as a basis from which-our mind is able to
abstract the universal idea. Their definition says 01 the Universal (as
known) that it exists formaliter in 11101110. suitdainentazirer in re. They
avoid defending a· position which they consider unsafe, and take up 000
which it'is very difficult to attack with any chance 1113000033. Asked by
Nominalists if the redness of the rose, the geranium, and the cherry, is
a real universal, they reply: lts reality is formally in the objectS, funda-
mentally in the mind; its universality is formally in the mind, fundamen·
tally in the objects. Asked by those of Wyclif's school 11 there is nothing
identical in two shades 01 colour in which there is 00 (1111010000, 11101
answer: Nothing but the aptitude they have 101 being grasped in one
1110ος that aptitude, in objects similarly coloured, 1101110111313ς and when
0111101011 thus grasps them, it becomes actual — but only in the mind.
This may seem obscure, but l can find no words to state it more
clearly: and indeed this seems to me the true solution 01 the whole
problem. Ido not 300 what the most determincd Nominalist could find
to attack in this reply‚ if be understood it properly. It might perhaps
not satisfy him; for it keeps up a strict relation between signs, 111003,
and things, between the subjective and the objective order, and maintains
the validity of human reason without restrictions, in rulrolener spuere i!

most embarrassing objection: How can anything 110 real and yet not

'l‘hey might indeed be classilied according to the lirst principle ol
abstract Being. For instance: Whatever is, is, uitet it is; is anything is,
it is; it is rvliilst it is, and so on (p. 3, l. 1-6; p. 7, l. 5—10). But
God’s existence is the strst truth of all3 no other can he known per-
lectly without it, and in that sense it is prior even to the principle ol
contradiction, though both are equally primitive as regards the truths
which llow from them (pp. 7, 8).

Other words might de employed to lorm new species ol hypo·
thetical propositions (p. 3, l. 13—30). But they may always be analyzed
into one ol those already given. Nei her - nor, sor instance, means the
same as arrd with a negative (pp. 8, 9). 'l'hese propositious may be
combined with each other to the number ol 1203 but this does not
increase the number ol primary species. For if Ι say, A is B il C is l),
because E is F, it is a causal proposition; but il we have, A is B, if
C is D because E is F, the proposition is conditional (pp. 9, 10). llere
Wyclil solves a number ol sophisms at considerable length. lt was no doubt
usesul and even necessary sor students us those times to know them; a
the present day, most ol us would, sor all these sophisms, endorse our
author's opinion concerning certain among them, and say with him:
suit! titilu' odibiles (p. 14, l. 5). It is, however, worth while to note his
remark that a sentence, however, long it may be, is a proposition, pro·
vided it imply one predominant act ol the mind; where there are several
it is not one proposition, and can neither be assumed nor denied as
one. The aflirmation or negation bears upon the hypothetical sign. God
existe, arud ,von ure uir ass, is denied without any reference to its com·
ponent parts separately (p. 10).

But there seems to have been a personal argument, particularly
directed against Wyclif’s theory os universals, which may be noticed

apart. We must remember that the universal “animal'‘, in this theory, is

a real thing or entity, identical both in men and in brutes. So wc have:
“You are now rulrateeer you would be, il you were an ass; in that case
you could bray, therefore you ean now.” This somewhat humorous
syllogism is gravely discussed, lor it entails grave consequences. Wyclis
not only grants that the major premiss is true, but that the minor is
necessary (p. 10, l. 35—41); but this is quite natural, if we refer to his
theory. He answerS, however, that though a man is identical with an
ass, the identity is only partial. What would be necessary to conclude

INTRODUCTION.

the difficulty, which might sor a time be more satisfactory to some ol
his pupils. 'I‘hey were sree to grant that universals might be counted
apart [rom their singulars, though in reality one with them; or to deny
it, because they are not different things. “But l‚” says Wyclil‚ at the
close oi the chapter, “stick to my hrst antwer” (Ι. 30). ll the name os
Doctor Evangelicus had not been given to him, he might have deserved,
as well as is not better than Durandus, the title ol Doctor Resolu-
tissimus.

Chapter III. Under cover os investigating the nature os disjunctive
propositions, Wyclif continues the debate on Universals, and now pro·
ceeds to carry the war into the cnemy’s country in a very practical
way: viz, by asserting that the very idea of a promise demonstrates
the truth ul his theory. But we must srrst ol all brielly note how he
gets to this subject Τ he proposition which contradicts a disjunctive is a
copulative os which both parts are contradictory to the former: as, Ais B
or A is C: contr. A is not B and A is not C (p. 56, l. 6, 7). Now
arrd A may be replaced by and it: so here, as in the foregoing chapter,
comes the question; lor what do pronouns stand? In other words, ought
the Realist or the Nominalist view to prevail? Only here the held of
discussion is restricted and specihed. l promise a penny. There is there·
lore a penny which l promise. Does this which relate to a universal
penny, or toa singular one? Wyclif at once and ol course chooses the
first alternative. He says that, is anything singular is meant, not only
philosophy, but political science and even all human untercourse must
go by the board. And not only the act of promising becomes impossible,
but purchase, sale, donatiam, acts os justice. rewards and punishments
are rendered null and void. When l promise a penny, a penny, according
to Nominalists, is a mere empty word, there being no universal penny,
but only singular ones; and so the promise becomes ineffective (p. 58).
One man owes another ἓ 20. According to NominalistS, even God’s
Almighty power could not make him pay. 'l‘here may be and arc parti·
cular sums called Ξ 20; but such a general promise oi what is buta
tintus cocis in itsell can have no value. And so on with many other
cases, which all result in constructive absurdities; constructive os course,

for, rightly or wrongly, they were denied by thev partisans of the opposite

system, Wyclif therefore declares (p. 59, l. 20) that we are obliged tu

admit the ancient doctrine of Universals, and closcs his case with

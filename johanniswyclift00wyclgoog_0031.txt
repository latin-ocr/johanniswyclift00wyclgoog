XXVIII INTRODUCTION.

l am — i. e. - infinitely beneath God — and changes nothing iu' Him
(pp. ror-103, l. 8).

And how would Wyclif, according to these lines, have answered
the Hegelian puzzle of the Ego and the Non·Ego? With the utmost ease.
My thinking of an object does not change the object iu itself; it only
makes it to be thought. The Non-Ego is the Ego - in my enine. Not
otherwise. My Ego, in thinking - i. e. nientally, is identical with the
Non-Ego; but only in so far. All this is merely a verbal, or if you
prefer, a notional becoming. And the bubble is burst.

From this Wyclif concludes that no inherent accident has any
existence of its own, or adds anything to its substance, as a substance
(p. 103, l. 8—25); that every proposition of which the predicate essen·
tially belongs to the subject infers a causal proposition, but not vice
eersd (for instance: alten is essentialia rational: ruem is rational because
lte ts arten, but, I erist because God reilts my existence gives no inference;
p. 103, l. 25 to p. 104, l. 7); that a conclusion from a cause to the
cause ol that cause is a true one (p. 104, l.7 to end), and that, while
God’s will causes my existence in the physical order, my existence causes
God's will to be what it is iu the intellectual order, i. e„ a cause. One
ol the two gives the entity‚ but does not prove the existence of the
other; whilst the latter proves the existence of the former, but does not
give it entity (p.105, l. 1 to p. 106, l. 9). It does not follow that either
is prior to the other, unless in two totally different orders: that of
belng, and that of cognition (p. 106, l. 9—25). Nor that God’s will,
being a mere relation between the Creator and the Created, cannot
cause anything (l. 26—34). Nor that any creature, to be willed, must
first of all exist (l. 34—37; p. ¹07· l. 1-8).

But can we draw the following negative inference from a causal
proposition: “l rio good because God ruitis it,· therefore, if God does not
rvitt it, l elo uot good &corase God does not rivitt it? lt is the very same
form of syllogism as the conclusive one which follows: Tire clay euists
becurrse tlte surr sitires· therefore, is tle sun does not slriue, tlte clay cloes
not exist because tire suu does not slriue. Some deny this; others explain the
inference, noting that we may suppose the sun not to shine on the earth¹

¹ l heve here slightly developed what l believe to he Wyclifs meaning. ln
other places, l have nor scrupled to add a comparison or a line of explanation of
my own, to render the sense clearer.

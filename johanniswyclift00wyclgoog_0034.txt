Singulars ol the Universal Man, or Humanity.

But it is quite clear that this objection goes to make Wyclif con-
tradict himself. ln so far as any man shares more perlectly in humanity,
in so lar he shares in it less perlectly! Os course the arguments are
all grossly fallacious3 but the subject itsels is too important to let them
pass without careiul refutation.

In the second place, we may notice the teudency ol Scholastic
philosophy to apply the mathematical method to metaphysical reasoning.
We have seen cases somewhat similar to this in Logica besore; but
nowhere does Wyclil mark it so strongly as here. He even goes the
length of supposing numbers! set down to denote the entitative perlec-
tions of diverse specics (pp. 119, 120) and points out the lallacy os
reasoning upon such numbers, if they do not stand lor homologous
things — 1 had almost said, quantities: sor he evidently has in his
mind the intensity os essential perlection, when he numbers them thus,
This seems to have been a tendency more or less to be lound in phi·
losophers ol all ages, who could not help admiring the sruitlul accuracy
ol the mathematical method‚ and contrasting it with the barren vagueness
ol their own speculations. Not to speak‘oi the ancients, ol the school
ol Pythagoras, and ol several curious passages in Plato and Aristotle,
we find a good many traces os this spirit in the works ol modern phi·
losophers. Spinoza and Wolll attempted to reduce two very diflerent
systems os philosophy to a series ol theorema, deduced one from the
other, like those ol Euclid. At the present day, Dc Murgan, Boole and

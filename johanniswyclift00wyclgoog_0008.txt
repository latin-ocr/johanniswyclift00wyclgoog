INTRODUCTION.

All details concerning the manuscript (Univ. Prag. V. E. 14) and

the authenticity and date ol the work itself having been discussed at
sufficient length in the Introduction to the first volume, we may at once
proceed to examine the second with regard to its contents alone. It
comprises the first eight chapters oi the third treatise os logica, or
more properly ol Logicue Continuam. Wyclis goes over the same ground
three times, it may be remembered: once in his Summary‚ or short

the work which forms the second and third volumes os the present
edition: in a most exhaustive manner this time, and treating os a variety

It is true that in this third treatise Wyclif ostensibly deals with hypo·
thetical propositions alone, and that he leaves out, or expounds only
parenthetically‚ many questions already quite threshed out in his srrst
volume. The difference‚ however, is to a great extent nominal. Both
categorical and hypothetical propositions are sor the most part as mere
headings oi chapterS‚ or as texts from which Wyclii preaehes his system
with greater or less detail. ln the third treatise‚ the matter is thus really
the same, but approached from a different standpoint‚ and expounded lor
more advanced students. Perhaps some apology will be necessary for
the very detailed summary that is to follow; issu, 1 may say thatI
thought it would not be quite useless to· go thoroughly through the sirst
work in which Wyclis’s system is set forth as a whole, and ol which
the other philosophical treatises are but modificatione and developments,

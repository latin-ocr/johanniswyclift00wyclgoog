many more: which would 001 be true, 11 all possible men existed at any
time tp, 79, 1. 22 top. 81, 1. 6).

But this llatly contradicts Wyclis' s principles. To answer the argu·
ments levelled against him, he makes a very remarkable and peculiar
use 01 1110 10101 infinite. He indeed 01111010 1110 existence 01 au infinite
number, but says that whatever exceeds our power 01 knowing distinctly,
is intinite to us. Thus, 10 give his own comparison — a striking one -
in a given line there is a desinite and sixed number 01 points, known to
God, but absolutely beyond our powers 01 apprehension. As a lact, we
must admit the existence 01 continuous extension: now, how many parts
are there in any such extended being? The more we divide it, the
more 01 111001 11011011, and we never cau get to the end 010111 division.
Yet God, who created them, knows each in particular, and the sum
total 01 111001 011 (p. 81, 1. 6-33).

Would Wyclis have considered the multitude 01 stars in the sky,
0111101011110 sands on the sea-shore, to be infinite? l think not; 101
they do not exceed our faculty 01 counting, but the time we have allotted
to us, 011110 instruments we are obliged to use; 11 we had time enough,
their aggregate would be represented by a number, 110110 even 1ο us·
He takes an instance 01 quite a different nature; - we might go on
counting 101 011 eternity the number 01 points in a line, or 01 parts in
a given volume, however small. Yet he contends that as those points
are really there (again a consequence 01 his doctrine; a Nominalist
would get out 01 1110 dilstculty by sayiug that they were mere entia
rationis), it is impossible both that their number should 001 110 known
10 God, aud that it should be infinite to Him. 11 10 therefore desinite.
'l‘o the length 01 00011 1100 corresponds a sured number 01 points; 01100
double that length will have twice as many, numbers beyond all arith-
metieal calculation, but numbers nevertheless. The idea is 001 wanting

in boldness and originality; but, like all speculations on these subjects,

it is liable to a good many lormidable objections.

Wyclil strengthens his position by observing that certain proposi·
tions which are evidently true must be denied il we reluse to admit this
conception 01 the lnsmite. Abody certainly consists 01 all its parts; but,
were there no desinite number, there would be no all,· the very term
supposes them either counted or 01 least numerable. Again, 10 Genesis,
''God saw all the things that Ηο had made‚” i. e. with all their details,

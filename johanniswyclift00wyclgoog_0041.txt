XXXVIII INTRODUCTION.

nerally believed that Schoolmen denied the existence of atoms. lt woul
be more correct to say that they passed them over. They of cours
combated the systems of Democritus and Epicurus; and, finding that th
system of matter and form sufficed to explain in metaphysical terms .
that was then known 01 natural phenomena. they generally did not troubl
themselves to enquire if atoms were or were not true in any other sens
St. 11101013, however, certainly says that there is and must be a limi
10 the divisibility of any corporeal substance, but he goes no farther.
Wyclif, with his principle that a limit not reached is not a limit, canno
help admitting atoms (p. 163, 1. 13-22). He grants, in answer t·
objections made, that the combination or decomposition of two atoms 1
instantaneous; but this does not prevent the chemical change of the whol
from taking up a certain time (p. 163, 1. 2 3- 31; p. 164, l. 1 3- 31). Το th
well-known difficulty, urged even in our days by Ultra-Thomists agaius
such Neo-Scholastics as believe in a ‘minimum naturale’, viz., that suc
atheory would reduce compound bodies to mere aggregans similar t
30 many heaps of sand, he denies the conclusion iu the case of organi
bodies, which have a supervening form that gives unity to the whole
but whether homogeneous inanimato substances are mere aggregates is
he says, a doubtful point ip. 163, l. 31—413 p. 164, 1. 31 10 p. 165
l. 37). Division is favourable to chemical change and on that accoun
alchemists calcine metals, to give them the more perfect forms (ug
that of gold, or ‘aureity'). But, as this calcination does not reduce th
metals to their ultimate partS, the successful result of their experiment
is ever a matter of chance. - We have thus: 1³¹, the elementary form

in the 0101113, and 2¹¹³, those of the compound: simple in themselves

these forms arc to a certain degree extended in the bodies 01 the lowe
animuls, which accounts for their continuing· to live, although divide
into several parts. As for monstcrs with double¹ organs, they are pro
perly two animals joined in one, and possess two forms, or vital prin
ciples (p. 165, l. 37 to p. 167, 1. 34).

become to increase our knowledge. Nor can there be any limit to the
raising ol a pile indeliuitely high (p. 139, l. 19—30). — All this is
absolutely denied. We know by saith that the Saints in Heaven do really
attain their maximum limit ol possible knowledge by means of the
beatific vision ol God. The question how this can be- alavourite one
both with Mediaeval and with modern Scholastics - is discussed at
some length. The blessed are not infinitely more perfect than we; lor
their knowledge is an accidental privilege, not an essential attribute.
Wychf inclines to think that they see all things in God; but, however
this may be, the essence ol felicity consists in the sight ol God Himsels;
Ι even were they ignorant ol something, they would none the less be

persectly happy (p. 168, l. ro to p. 174, l. 18). As to the raising ol a
pile indefinitely high, ol course the higher it went, the more dilltcult it

would be to raise it any surther; and there would come a point at
which it would exhaust all the powers ol the whole human race to get
even one more stone to the summit. Thus, Nature imposes a limit to
men in all things; excessive increase of anything, lor instance, ol
Church ceremonias aad possessione is hurtlul. This is a seed which, at
a later period developed into an enormous tree (p. 174, l. 33 to
p. 175, l. 22).

6. A minimum ol visibility is absurd. Seeing a surface, we see
the whole ol it, and therefore we conlusedly see all its parts, even to
the inlinitely small. -— But Wyclil posits as an evident principle that
whatever is seen consusedly might, under other circumstances, he dis·
tinctly seen. This takes all the force out ol the olrjection. Amathe·
matical point cannot be seen distinctly under any circurnstances; lor the
smallest thing visible must hc the base ol apyramid having its apex in
the eye. ‘l‘he chapter comes to aclose with sonte details on the struc-
ture au‘d organism ol the eye, which rnay bc curious as representing
the state ol optical sciencc in those days3 hut l am not in a position
to discuss them thoroughly; scarcely at all. As Wyclil avowedly takes
most ol what he says from the workS, not only ol Alhazen, hut also ol the
lamous Vitellio (Ciolek) ol Cracow, one of the most celebrated opticians
in the Middle liges, l should have likcd to compare his anatomical
description with the summary given by our author. Unlortunately, the
work in question was not in the Jagellonian Library when l asked lor
it, having been lent out at some distance from Cracow; hut the English

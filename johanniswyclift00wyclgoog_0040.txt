shorter time (θ’) a smaller power, A‘, would be able to beat· this same
weight B; this, in the opinion ol the adversaries, would prove that no
power has a special maximum 01 its own (p. 138, l. 38 to p. 139, l. 9).
Wyclil answers here at great length (pp. 152— 162), giving many difle-
rent senses ol the word ‘difficulty'3 but we need not go into them. The
gist ol his reply (p. 159, l. 4—10) is that the notion ol a maximum
must here be considered with regard to the time, and not apart. We
may, however, in this long and discursive reply, note several striking
sentences, some paradoxical, some quaint, and some proving a con·
siderable knowledge os mechanics, as then known. “Oi all difficult
things — i. e. 01 those which deteriorale the agent that does them —
mortal sin is the most dilsrcult (p. 155, l. 26, 27).’' “ln the sense 01
‘something to be mastered’, the universe is a difficulty to God Himself
(p. 156, l. 20-25).'’ “Withont God’s aid we should find it as difficult
10 move a bean as to make a world (p. 157, l. 29-31).’' “ln the act
of sustaining‚ much depends on the manner os application oi the weight,

An egg will not be crushed even by a considerable lorce; a sail will

bear up against a strong wind; and experiments with levers prove this
abundantly and in a marvellous way (multa mirabilia iacere, p. 160,
l. 25—34).” “The least weight a man cannot sustain is the greatest
that he can (p. 160, l. 34—37),” “Weight implies distance lrom the
centre, or 110111 the proper sphere ol each element; water -in its own
sphere has no weight, as divers tell uS, and l suppose that it is the
same lor the earth too (p. 161, l. 14-16).”

4. The higgest or the smallest man possible is impossible. 11 the
lormer got a hump (tunsionem), he would then be 100 big to exist. ls
the latter lost a hair (quamlibet ablationem partis superlluae), he would
be too small. —- This humorous argument is answered on p. 167
(l. 34 81 seq.) where it is pointed ont that, though the greatest possible
giant could not assimilate any more iood, so long as his body remained
01 that size, a swelling would not render his organism, as a living body,
any the larger. And a similar train 01 reasoning would apply to the
smallest dwarf. But before this reply, we come to a very interesting
digression (pp. 162-166). Wyclil, admitting a minimum 01 size 101 all
bodily substances, implicitly asserts the existence 01 atoms 110111 the very
ontset (minima naturalia; p.1d2, l. 11), and a lew pages later, he openly
gives them their right name lathomorum p. 166, l. 32). lt is 100 ge-

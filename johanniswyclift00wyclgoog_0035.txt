Jevons have in turn endeavoured to adapt Algebra to Logic or Logict
Algebra3 whilst Abbi: Gratry, in F rance, has tried to prove God aud th
Creation by the interpretation oi certain mathematical formulae. And, t
restriet myseli to Mediaeval Scholasticism, we by no means sind Wycl
alone in his way ol looking at ideas — or rather at their unire .
olijects - as though they were measurable things, llere l must regr·
not having taken note, in times gone by, of several passages t
St. ihomas, in which he distinctly speaks, lor instance, oi the disianc
between the most perfect brute and man as greater than that betwee
tbe former and a plaut. Here we see an explicit comparison betwee
two entitative differences. There are also in his works certain argumen
which, though referring to pure abstractim, might very well be repre
sented by an algebraical equation, if we admitted the assumption alreadr
mentioned. l equally regret not being able now to find the passages

celer to; but lise would be too short to look through the multitudinou
iolios ol tbe Angelic Doctor; lhad to glance here and there, where

thought l had most chance to lind them. One argument, l remembe
well, struck me as being based on the implicit assumption that “wh ι
two variable ‹luantities (or objects oi ideas) are always equal to eac
ntber as thcy approach the constants by which they arc respectivel,
limited, those constants are also equal to each ‹ither²'. And we ma
fairly believe that il, in the days ol Schoolmen, mathematics had attaine
the high degree ol development at which they stand now, there woul·

bare been wrought a complete transformation oi bletaphysics; not per

haps to its disadvantage.

Setting aside the detailed examination of the debate, as useles
and uninteresting to us, we may however notice by the way what Wyclil
in bis answer to the iourth objection, remarks concerning goodne
(p. 122 to and ol chapter). Utility has no intrinsic clement oi goodness
it is good only extrinsicalli, and varies according to the demand for th·-
thing tbat is useiul. But reversely, whatever possesses intrinsic goodnes
possesses utilite too; so does also that which is bad in itseli; lor eve
sin has its use in the world. lntrinsical goodness is divided into tw·
sprecies: that which is physically and that which is morally good. Th
latter is always useiul, at least to some extent, virtue never can bs
badly employed: yet it may at times be less uselul than what is merel)
extrinsically good. The same division oi ent must be 1nade; itis eithe

reply: “The Trinity is a mystery3 are Real lfniversals so? 11 they arc,
saith and not reason should make us believe in them. 11 they are not,
they? destroy the mysterious nature of the 'l‘rinity itsell.” It is perhaps
as an answer to this objection, never stated in so many words, that our
author in several passages ol his works (and 13 particular a lew pages
Ι further, pp. 51, 52) takes care to note the differences between the
Universal and the Divine Essence. 11111 he only points out other myste-
ries, aud leaves the that which distinction untouched, as parallel in both
cases. - The serious difficulty, viz„ that universals must move about, as
they are wherever their singulars happen to be, is taken into earnest
consideration (p. 47). Wyclis inclines to think that they move; at the
same time he denies that this implies localization 111 the Universal.
Fourth. 'Phe most diflicult point os all, where the writer seems to
be most uncertain, and which he probably developed and explained at
a later period, is, “How the Universals can be said to make upa
number with their singulars”. 11 the individual man A and the universal
man are identical, they are not two, but one; il, on the other hand, there
is a real distinction between them, they must be two realities, and be
counted as such (p. 48, l. 3—10). lt seems impossible to get a satis-
factory answer to this objection; at least that contained in the present

work seems to me rather lame, so 131 33 1 have succeeded in under-
standing it; and when l collated the chapter os De Universulibus, “Quo-
modo universalia ponunt in numero‚” 1 was too busy with the collation

itsell to pay much attention to the manner in which Wyclil supplements
what seems vvttuting here. For a man 111 our nuthor’s skill and subtlety,
it would have been very easy to wrap up'his answer in a string ο1
sentences impossible to understand, and signilying anytbing — or nothing;
such a mode ο1 proceeding· would have been not without great precedents
even in bis time3 and contemporary philosophers might perhaps tell us
whether 11 hasbeen quite abandoned at the present day. But Wyclis‚ often
unintelligible when pursuing some ol his lavourite theories out 111 sight, is
never so on purpose to embarrass an adversary. He may be lost in the
clouds; he does not hide himself in mists. His sturdy English nature prefers
momentary sels-contradiction to wilful ambiguity, and remains in seeming
absurdity until such time as he can geta satisfactory reply to what per-
pletes him. This, 1 believe, will appear a little lurthcr. l do not think
that it takes anytbing arvav 111131 the admiration due to his talent, and

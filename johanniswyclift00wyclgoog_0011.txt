that a man is an ass, is the identity of individuality, not that of a uni·
versal attribute. But he adds: “l know that this answer does not please
sophists” (p. 16, l. 11-27).

The affirmative or negative nature of hypotheticals is then investi-
gated. Any proposition might with truth be called both affirmative and
negative, since all affirm God's existence, and deny whatever is contrary
to their affirmation (pp. 16, ty). We must therefore consider how best
to classify them. Some say that in any proposition composed of two,
both propositions should be affirmative, or both negative, for the com·
pound to be one or the other; so that, where this requisite is wanting,
the resulting proposition is neither (pp. 18, l. 31—38l. Others, that the
nexus alone, affirmed or denied‚ determines the quality of these proposi·
tions (p. 18, l. 39 to end; p. 19, l. 1-9). Others again, with whom
Wyclif partly agrees, say that they follow the quality of the first of their
parts (v- Ι9)· ’

As for the quantity, i. e. the universality or particularity of such
propositions, the first three are said to have no quantity at all; but the
last four (causals, comparatives, locals and temporals) follow the quantity

’ of the first of their parts (p. 20). It may be objected (p. 21, Ι. 25) that

these last are really categorical in meaning, since they may be expressed

in a categorical form. This. however, is a mere matter of tastc and
preference. Some prefer the number three, others the number seven.
Wyclif chooses not to eliminate the four last specics, because every
point in the universe, is touched by six, and only six other points: thus
making up the number seren. We need not here explain this reason
further than to say that it is at the root of his cosmological system, in
which the universe is built of mathematical points. ln the next volume,
we shall see the whole theory developed at great length.

Chapter II. After a few preliminary remarks about copulative pru·
positions, with which the chapter professes to deal (pp. 2 3—26), Wyclif
launches boldly into the problem of the Universals. One is at first puzzled
to see how he manages to bring it in. lt begins with the question (p. 26)
whether or no a pronoun stands merely for its antecedent, a particular·
concrete being, or for its antecedent as affirmed by a preceding verb.
For instance: “Socrates is an animal, and irisan ass;” do we mean
by it an animal in general, or that animal witich is Socrates? llere wc
notice that any copulative proposition in which one of the terms of tlre

INTRODUCTION. XXV

siders as possible only such as are so in reality‚ and at one time or
other must exist: this does away with all the difficulties that can be
brought lorward (pp. 86-88t The system in vogue at his time, refusing
to limit God's power ol creating all that is possible in the abstract
reuders it necessary to deny that such a multitude is infinite. Wyclil,
limiting God’s power by His will, calls the sixed number ol possible
things that will be produced, infinite to us (p. 88 to end ol chapter).

Chapter V. brings us to a discussion ol causal propositions, alter
the writer's usual fashion, expounding his views on causes, accideuts,
modes ol being, the identity ol God causing Man with Man caused by
God, and the origin of evil.

Ol such propositions there are two kinds, the one affirmative, the
other negative, and each is reducible to a categorica} having the same
sense. A conditional proposition does not imply causatiom but only a
nexus between two propositions, neither does a copulative, which means
nothing beyond the coexistence ol the two (pp. 9ο, 91). Accidents are
caused by their subjects: because you are a man, you have such and
such qualities. This is a prool that accident and subject are distinct
entities, unless we deny the truth ol causal propositions in general; but such
a denial' would be subversive ol all science (p. 91, l. 12-39l· ‘Cause’
cannot properly be defined, any more than ‘being’, because their spheres
are equally universal. We can only state that the word signihes ‘that
which produces an eflect’, that ol which the entity precedes the thing
caused; whilst ‘effect’ is that other being produced, and ol which the
entity ssows from that cause. All beings are causes and ellects. Possibly
there is no last being, but there is a strst one; which is, according to
Wyclil‚ not God, ¹but Essence. This essence is that which is created
(unum creatum); but it is itsell neither created nor caused. ln short, it
seems identical with that 'l‘ranscendent Being, ol which we have already
heard a good deal, and which is common both to God and to the
creature; a conception so closely verging upon Pantheism that Wyclis
avoids that conclusion only by his surprisiug skill in argument, and the
constant employment ol the highest mysteries ol the Christian faith used
as points ol comparison and instances to maintain the value oi his
subtle distinctions (p. 91, 1. 39, 403 p. 92, l. 1-18).

He then proceeds to enumerate the lourlold division of causes into
material, formal, ellicient and sinal, each 'ol which is a cause either per
